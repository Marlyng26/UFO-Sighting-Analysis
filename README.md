For the UFO Sighting analysis, I created a basic HTML web pages and used index.html file. Using the UFO dataset provided, I wrote a code that appends a table to my webpage and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. Next, I used a date orm in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the data/time column to find rows that match user input.
